# Upgrade Notes for v1.3.0 (Pending)

These notes document configuration and environment changes in v1.3.0. They will be folded into the release notes by PR #438.

## Antivirus Scanning: Banner for Offline Policies

When the attachment scan policy is off and stored attachments carry earlier scan results (or any attachment exists with no scan policy ever configured), administrators see a banner on the admin panel with the exact fix:

1. Add `COMPOSE_PROFILES=antivirus` to `docker/.env`
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
3. Set the scanner address in Settings → Attachments

The banner reads:

> Attachments are not being scanned. To turn scanning back on, add `COMPOSE_PROFILES=antivirus` and `CLAMAV_ADDR=tcp://clamav:3310` to `docker/.env`, run `docker compose up -d`, then confirm the scanner address under Settings → Attachments. To keep scanning off, choose "Do not scan" there.

It appears only when no scan policy was ever saved, no scanner address is set (in Settings or in the environment) and at least one attachment exists. Settings → Attachments also shows the scanner's policy, whether an address is configured, whether it answers, and what that means for uploads.

Explicitly choosing "Do not scan" in the policy dropdown clears the banner. The exception is documented in DESIGN.md:1177-1183 — until a policy is explicitly set, the banner warns about unscanned uploads even in "off" mode.

## New Environment Variables (Compose-Forwarded)

The following variables are now honoured when set in `docker/.env`. They are automatically forwarded to the app container and have sensible defaults in Docker Compose:

### `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`

- **Default**: `10`
- **Description**: Failed password attempts per account per minute before a 429 response. `0` disables both password-attempt limiting and signup limiting. In-process counters reset on restart; each replica maintains its own budget, so N replicas multiply the limit by N.
- **Note**: TOTP verification has its own strict budget (durable on the user row) and is not affected by this setting.

### `AUTH_THROTTLE_DELAY`

- **Default**: `1s`
- **Description**: How long a login waits before checking the password, for accounts that have spent their failed-attempt budget. Bounds online guessing to the server's bcrypt throughput (roughly 10–15 guesses/second/core). Must be a positive duration (e.g., `1s`, `500ms`, `1m`); cannot be zero at startup.
- **Impact**: A legitimate user who exhausts the budget still succeeds — their correct password is always honoured, just after the delay.

## JWT Secret (`JWT_SECRET`)

`JWT_SECRET` is now **optional**:

- If **unset or under 32 bytes**: A random 32-byte key is generated once and stored in the database. All instances in the cluster read the same key from the database.
- If **32+ bytes**: The environment value is used as-is (the long value wins over the generated key).
- **Upgrade path**: If you set `JWT_SECRET` to a long value in `.env`, it remains in use and nothing changes. If you unset it or provide a short value, a new key is generated on first boot. **OAuth clients must fetch a new access token once** (sessions are unaffected; they use `SESSION_SECRET`).
- **Backup implications**: Database backups now contain the JWT signing key. Restoring a backup onto another instance carries the key with it (tokens remain valid there).
- **Rotation**: To rotate the key, delete the row from `instance_secrets` and restart. All OAuth tokens issued with the old key become invalid.

## `APP_ENV` Variable (Removed from Documentation)

The `APP_ENV` environment variable no longer has any effect. Setting it is harmless and will not break anything, but it is no longer documented. If you set it in your `.env`, you can safely ignore it or remove it; the server logs a single info message at startup if it is set.

The removal stems from #354 — the log level is now controlled via `LOG_LEVEL`, and `APP_ENV` serves no purpose.
